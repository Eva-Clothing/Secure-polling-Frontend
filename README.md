## Introduction 🏃‍♂️

### A secure polling applicatin for making the polling thing virtual and helps a person to cast vote at his own place.

<br>

## Idea behind it 💡

- Making voting vertual would help to cast a person his vote sitting at home , especially during the tough times of pandemic.
- Help the person living in foreign with his constituency, and would increase the voting percentage.

- Booth capturing , that happen certain areas would be pervented.

## Security Features 🔐

- Regestering and logging features using jwt and bcrypt.js for hashing the password.

- **To add more to safety we have added a ML model for verification of his human nature. For that we have used a [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/) library to enable the ML model in the application.**
  <br>

## Features 🔑

- Register and login features using jwt and bcrypt.js
- Facerecognizer 😁 using ML model for adding a extra level of security🔐.

- **The person can cast a vote only once of the date of his choice.**
- A person can cast only one vote ⚠

- ### **Data manupulation and visualization** 📈

  - The vote once casted,data is recorded in the database and is visualised as table,BarGraph and LineGraph

  - The Table shows the data of the persons casted the vote, with the date of vote being casted and the choice

  - BarGraph shows the count of 'Yes' and 'No' along with the 'Total' number of votes being casted.

  - LineGraph shows the count of 'Yes' and 'No' on the particular date on using diffrent Lines on the Graph.

- **Photo Booth section for making a personalised card after he has casted the vote , as a token of remembrance for sharing it in the social media platform 🐤.**

## Future Scope and some suggested features 👩‍💻

Keeping in mind the **digital india campaign** the future polling must be done digitally. So this application is a great initiative towards making this possible.

<hr>

### _Towards making the application more secure_ :-

- **Pre-regrestation of elegible candidate for polling in the elections, and he would be provided the dates for polling.**
- **Asking user his recent photo for matching him aginst the ML model and verifing the user.**
- 🛑 Provding the user a date that is end to end encrypted so as to prevent the threatning aginst any political leader.
